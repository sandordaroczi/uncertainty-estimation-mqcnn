# Introduction

This project contains the code for the paper titled
"Evaluating algorithms for probabilistic forecasting and uncertainty estimation in regression problems".

It contains the implementation of several uncertainty estimation models for application in a retail use-case,
such as LightGBM, LightGBM Quantile Regressor, Bootstrapping, NGBoost, Probabilistic Gradient Boosting Machines (PGBM),
Level Set Forecaster (LSF), Conformalized Regression, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and MQ-CNN.

Moreover, under the notebooks folder you can find the python notebooks we used to train and evaluate our models on Kaggle datasets.
The Kaggle datasets we used for the evaluation are the following:

1. Blue Book For Bulldozers (bulldozer)
2. Rossmann Store Sales (rossmann)
3. CorporaciÂ´on Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting (favorita)

# Getting Started

## 1. Installation

Currently, the package installation can be done only via poetry.
Read [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) about how to install and set up poetry on your local machine.

After you have cloned the project and set up poetry, create a virtual environment and install packages from the pyproject.toml file via

````commandline
poetry update
poetry install
````

Then, build the project using

````commandline
poetry build
````

After that, 

````commandline
pip install uncertainty_estimation_models_mqcnn-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
````

First, make sure you have separately installed the various dependencies (see below).

For running the notebooks with CPU it is required to install the mxnet package via `pip install mxnet`. For GPU usage however the package mxnet-cu113 has to be installed via pip: `pip install mxnet-cu113`.

The notebooks have only been tested to work on Windows 10 and MacOs 13+.

### Dependencies

# Build and Test

Navigate to the directory you want the git repo to live in, then run

````commandline
git clone https://github.com/daroczisandor/uncertainty-estimation-mqcnn.git
cd uncertainty_estimation_mqcnn
````

Obtain data from Google Drive

Store it in a folder called "datasets" at the top level of this repo
(this is where the notebooks point to when reading data).

Datasets can be found in Google Drive under this link:
